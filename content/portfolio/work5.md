An encrypted home security system with DIY crocheted keys.
<!--more-->
The inspiration for this project is a variegated 8 ply yarn called [Crypto](https://www.ausyarnco.com.au/crypto-8-ply). Using similar yarn, I crocheted a set of plush keys and then taught a computer to recognize the keys using Machine Learning techniques.

The key to successful key encryption (pun intended) is variegated or multicolored yarn. With every stitch, you are encrypting a code that is impossible to duplicate. The project is created to be inclusive and empowering for those of us skilled in other ways than traditional programmers and to demonstrate how our skills contribute to data technologies

Here you will find a link to the [3 part tutorial](https://anu1905.medium.com/secure-your-home-iot-devices-with-the-cryptocrochet-key-f94fb7392326) to the CryptoCrochet-Key project. It begins with instructions for making the key and then moves to the Machine Learning part of the project. The final part shows how to run the CryptoCrochet-Key Machine Learning model securely on a Raspberry Pi 4.
