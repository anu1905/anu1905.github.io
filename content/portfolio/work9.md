Can you 'read' AI generated images of historic craft patterns? 
<!--more-->

This project is critique of general purpose AI models built from large scale datasets. It closely investigates AI generated images of cross-stitch patterns and makes an attempt to 'read' these images with the help of theoretical/philosophical constructs and historical embroidery archives.

I've [written up](https://formy.xyz/en/artykul/reading-ai-family-resemblances-using-cross-stitch-patterns/) the project for Formy.xyz, an online design magazined published by the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow, Poland.

My exploration led to learning about a Ukrainian handicraft, 'Pysanky', which incorporates stylized lettering (Cyrillic alphabet) and symbols in pixel art-like form, which I decided to try out for myself in paper, embroidery, and 3D printing.
