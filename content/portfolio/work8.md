Crochet a Resistor Cushion for colour-coded resistors.
<!--more-->

A Resistor Cushion is a plushie cushion designed for colour-coded resistors. Like a pin/needle cushion, the idea is to stick resistors into a plushie, with the added practicality of matching an individual resistor's color code. It helps to keep resistors organised and identify them quickly. I made this project to get into the hacker mindset using my fiber arts practice while exploring the boundaries of what counts as Open Source Hardware.   

The crochet pattern for the cushion has been certified as Open Source Hardware (OSHW) under the CERN Open Hardware License (CERN-OHL-1.2) and the documentation is licensed under the Creative Commons Attributions (CC-BY-4.0) license.

The tutorial was orginally published in a [medium blog post](https://anu1905.medium.com/crochet-your-own-resistor-cushion-553080158f48) and later in [Hackspace Magazine Issue#40](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.com/issues/40).
