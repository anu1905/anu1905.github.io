Experiments in embroidering kolam patterns using drawing and code.
<!--more-->

This project is a collaboration between myself and [Alex McLean](https://slab.org/), a musician (Yaxu) and researcher. I was funded by ThenTryThis and Alex's UKRI Fellowship to explore Kolam patterns for the [Algorithmic Pattern project residency](https://thentrythis.org/notes/2023/09/11/algorithmic-pattern-residents-announcement/) in Sheffield, UK. 

During the residency, Alex and I experimented with machine-embroidered grid structures and musical Strudel rhythms for drawing Kolams in stitches and code. The idea was to play with Kolam-drawing in different mediums such as embroidery and music, and explore their intersections to appreciate the historic craft using novel approaches.  

We documented the entire residency process [in this article](https://alpaca.pubpub.org/pub/eljjyi80/release/6).
