Can folk embroidery help establish digital consent?
<!--more-->

B00b-factor Authentication (suggested pronounciation ‘bee-zero-zero-bee’ or ‘bewb’) is a project about intimacy and trust.Inspired by an heritage craft called Banjara Embroidery︎︎︎, this project showcases a bra with NFC tags embroidered around the nipple areas. Two tags, one for each b00b, permit two-factor authentication. The right tag leads to a password-protected website, and the left reveals the password to it. If a person wishes to unlock the website, they need to first establish consent with the bra’s wearer. In getting close to wearer’s body, the b00b-factor authentication bra materialises the discomfort of seeking intimacy and trust with remote others you barely know.

The project has been published in [ACM Interactions magazine](https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/january-february-2023/b00b-factor-authentication-unmaking-intimacies-and-trust#top), and it has been covered in [German media](https://www.heise.de/news/B00b-Factor-Authentication-Stickprojekt-mit-NFC-Anbindung-7102848.html) and [written about](https://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/view/2938) by other researchers.
