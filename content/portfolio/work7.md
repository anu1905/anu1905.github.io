I had fun geeking out on graph theory and Kolams (traditional South-Indian folk art). This fascinating dig into folk art and computation resulted in me discovering a drawing hack to make Euler Circuits as Kambi Kolams out of any given set of nodes and edges. I present the resulting outcome as an A3 sized poster.
