In plain view, the towel below looks like any other knitted fabric with an unrecognisable pattern. When the fabric is tilted to 45 degrees, it reveals a QR code detectable to any smartphone. This project is an exploration into hidden data recognition using just fiber arts. I crocheted the towel using two patterning techniques namely lenticular images and QR codes, resulting in an absurdly new kind of computational object.

The process is the application of computational thinking to making and crafting. My goal was to devise something new and valuable through by remixing materials, patterns, and abstractions with ideas, objects, and systems.
