Draw kolam patterns everyday using a hybrid computational and human-drawing approach.
<!--more-->
Kolam is a centuries old South-Indian folk art form. These are hand-drawn patterns made using a grid of dots (pulli) and are passed down through generations of Tamil women.

In this project, I demystify the underlying math logic behind Kambi (wire) Kolams by combining computational (graph algorithms) and human (N-line) drawing methods to appreciate the historical artform in a novel way. More details about the project can be found [here](https://alpaca.pubpub.org/pub/xywz3ebv/release/1) in the proceedings of first [Algorithmic Pattern Salon](https://salon.algorithmicpattern.org/) that took place in 2023.

Draw Kolams (go to [www.kolam.day](www.kolam.day)) by following the algorithm (or rules) illustrated in the accompanying zine below. Itâ€™s like solving a puzzle, enjoy!
