This device is a solar-powered contraption with two modes - cyberdeck and deckchair. In cyberdeck mode, use the device as a Pomodoro timer to aid your work productivity. When you are tired of working, activate the deckchair mode and recharge under the sun, both you and the device. 

The project is designed as a practical reminder to take regular breaks. To set the Pomodoro 25 minute timer, press the left button A (left blue buckle). The LED grid display indicates the passage of time in 5 minute intervals. To reset the timer, press the right button B (right blue buckle).

Materials: Cotton yarn, Crochet hook 3mm. BBC Micro:Bit, DF Robot Micro Solar Power Manager, 3.7V LiPo 250mAh battery, 1-3V solar panel. Programmed in Microsoft MakeCode
