### Hi :-) I'm Anu.   

**This is Algocraft**—a project portfolio where I remix traditional design and cultural craft practices with open-source tools, interactive software and hardware.

My work spans design research, human-computer interaction, and new media. Whether I’m untangling a tricky data problem or unraveling the logic behind a woven pattern, I find joy in the process—and it’s that blend of thinking and making that fuels my practice.

By day, I'm a knowledge worker in the software industry. Off the clock, you’ll probably catch me volunteering, stitching up pieces for a capsule wardrobe, or dreaming up the next big (or small) idea with fellow makers and crafters.

![This is me][1]
